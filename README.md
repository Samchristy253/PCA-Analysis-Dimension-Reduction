# Unsupervised Learning: Dimensionality Reduction using PCA

This repository presents an in-depth implementation and explanation of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, a widely-used unsupervised learning technique for **dimensionality reduction** in machine learning and data science.

## 📌 Overview

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional form while preserving as much variability as possible. It is commonly used to simplify datasets, improve visualization, and reduce computational complexity.
